**Why I write this post?**
Saying sorry is a good habit, but saying it too much is the contrast. Sometimes, we apologize too much and it affects your presence. Replace sorry with a better phrase will make your ideas more compelling and show up stronger.

If you’re someone who knows the value of a good apology, you’re way ahead of most people.

But if you apologize constantly for every little thing – whether or not it’s warranted – listen up. You may be standing in the way of your success. Because it weakens your presence and your confidence.

Presence is an elusive trait. It’s our ability to own the room. The [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2012/08/de-constructing-executive-pres) describes it as “your ability to project mature self-confidence; a sense that you can take control of difficult, unpredictable situations, make tough decisions in a timely way, and hold your own with other talented and strong-willed team members.”
